# Personal deep learning projects

This repository hosts the code used in my personal Kaggle Competition submissions for various machine learning and deep learning tasks. It also hosts the code for other personal projects used in learning to use deep learning for real-world tasks.

## Kaggle Competitions
1. House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques. The goal is to predict the sale price of a home. Uses RMSE to score, so lower is better.\
  Result: 0.16181, rank 3445.
2. Digit Recognizer. The goal is to predict the number shown on an image using MNIST dataset. Uses accuracy to score, so higher is better.\
  Result: 0.98128, rank 1622.
## Other projects
1. CIFAR-10 classifier. The goal is to correctly classify the images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
